I HAD NOT USED AJAX SINCE ATTENDING THE FLATIRON SCHOOL, SO I HAD STUDY THIS AS WELL FOR A REFRESHER. I CREATED THE PROXY.PHP FILE AS SUGGESTED. FIRST I CREATED AN INDEX.HTML FILE AND CREATED THE FORMS AND TABLE AS FOLLOWING THE PROVIDED OUTLINE. I THEN CREATED A PROXY.PHP FILE AND AS I WAS STUDYING AND LEARNING THIS AS I WAS CODING, I READ A LOT ABOUT INCLUDING THE PHP WITHIN THE HTML, OR THE OPPOSITE ACTUALLY, AND SO I CHANGED THE HTML FILE TO INDEX.PHP. THIS TOOK ME A COUPLE OF DAYS TO COMPLETE AND GET IT RIGHT WITH THE ECHOS AND DOTS, BUT I LEARNED AND NOW CAN SAY I UNDERSTAND THIS PROCESS WITH CONFIDENCE.

THE LOGIN FORM AND TRANSACTION FORMS TOGETHER WITH THE PHP AND HTML ALONE TOOK TWO DAYS OF ABOUT 6 HOURS EACH, BUT I DID HAVE TO GO BACK AND REFACTOR ON OTHER DAYS.


I STUDIED HOW TO MAKE THE API CREDENTIALS HIDDEN, WHICH I HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE AND THAT WAS COOL.


I STRUGGLED A LOT WITH GETTING THE TRANSACTION FORM TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. I SPENT HOURS TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS. IT WOULD WORK SPORADICALLY, WHICH IS ANNOYING.




I ACTUALLY HAD A LOT OF ISSUES WITH MAMP AND APACHE AND SERVER ISSUES, BUT IT TOOK ME AWHILE TO REALIZE THIS IS WHAT THE MAIN ISSUE WAS AND I KEPT CHANGING MY CODE, THINKING I WASN'T DOING IT CORRECTLY. THIS TOOK UP FOUR DAYS OF STRUGGLE. FINALLY, I REALIZED IT WAS THE SERVER AND INSTEAD BEGAN WORKING WITH php -S localhost:8000. USING THIS FROM THE TERMINAL COMMAND LINE AND THEN LOCALHOST:8000 IN THE BROWSER, ALLOWED ME TO WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY. (I asked Rocio for help when I was stuck for days before realizing it was a server issue, she is amazing)

I ALSO STRUGGLED WITH THE FormData OBJECT METHOD. I COULDN'T GET IT TO WORK AND EVENTUALLY USED Serialize INSTEAD IN JavaScript. I spent a couple of hours in two different days, really trying to get formData to work.

THE FINAL AND MOST FUN PART FOR ME IS THE CSS STYLING (I COME FROM AN ARTS BACKGROUND, SO DESIGN IS MY RAINBOW OF SKITTLES). I SPENT A LOT OF TIME, TWO DAYS ON THIS, WANTING TO REALLY DO A GREAT JOB.

I AM NOT 100 PERCENT HAPPY WITH THIS, BUT I REALLY WANT TO GET THIS DEPLOYED (WHICH I KNOW IS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME SINCE I HAVE ONLY USED AWS, AND I WANT TO USE HEROKU) TODAY SO THAT I DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS OPPORTUNITY.

I AM DEFINITELY HAPPY THIS WAS AN OPEN BOOK TEST, BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING WITH THE PHP, AT ALL. I LOVED LEARNING IT. I LOVED LEARNING curl_setopt, FOR EXAMPLE AND I REALLY LOVED LEARNING HOW TO PLACE PHP AND HTML TOGETHER. IT WAS ALSO A GREAT REVIEW ON AJAX AND JQUERY.

THANK YOU - XT :)
